# Destination-Loading

Our plan is to create a reservation/ticket manager, at the moment we're focusing on transportation and travel. Users will able to find and "store reservations" with established airlines and ground transport, such as Amtrak. We will also allow users to store benefits in a wallet, such as metro cards, airline miles, etc. If we have time, we'd like to maybe expand into other areas, or create a feature to potentially help users find people with similar interests to make plans with, using a simple algorithim.


`dsmelser's notes: this application is begging for an administrative view.  I'd like to see use cases for defining companies/tickets in the system (maybe even letting the user pick a logo), and defining perks.  Also, we're missing a learning objective.  Since this is handling sales an obvious one is something like payment integration with Stripe`
