# Destination-Loading

Our plan is to create a reservation/ticket manager, at the moment we're focusing on transportation and travel. Users will able to find and "store reservations" with established airlines and ground transport, such as Amtrak. We will also allow users to store benefits in a wallet, such as metro cards, airline miles, etc. If we have time, we'd like to maybe expand into other areas, or create a feature to potentially help users find people with similar interests to make plans with, using a simple algorithim.

Users can make an account that can hold their existing reservation 

The user would manually add ticket reservations and select a company that they're choosing to travel with 

They can view all their reservation in a view my reservations tab and it will sort by date (and future can be sorted by other catagories.)

Admin can manages different comapnies that are supoorted, thsi includes finding companies adding them, deleting them, and modifying them.

A user can click on a button to jump to the mange reservation page on their companies website.

We are also planning on using TypeScript in our IDE for our front-end development.

We may add payment integration, or the ability to store payment methods on an account, via Stripe, depending on how meeting our base requirements go.

`dsmelser's notes: this application is begging for an administrative view.  I'd like to see use cases for defining companies/tickets in the system (maybe even letting the user pick a logo), and defining perks.  Also, we're missing a learning objective.  Since this is handling sales an obvious one is something like payment integration with Stripe`
